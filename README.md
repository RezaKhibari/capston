# FinGuard
## Project Name: FinGuard
### Introduction:
FinGuard is a web application aimed at simplifying personal finance management for individuals and small businesses. The app will enable users to track their daily expenses, income, and overall financial health. It will offer features like budget planning, goal setting, and transaction tracking to help users make more informed financial decisions. The primary problem being addressed is the lack of intuitive, user-friendly tools that allow for real-time financial tracking and management, particularly for those unfamiliar with more complex banking software.
As financial literacy becomes increasingly important, FinGuard will aim to provide an accessible platform for users to manage their money efficiently, without needing an in-depth understanding of complex financial tools.

### General Functionality:

- **User Authentication:**  Secure login and account management for individuals and small business users.
- **Management:** Users can add, edit, or delete financial transactions (income and expenses) with ease.
- **Budget Planner:** Helps users set budgets for various categories (e.g., food, rent, entertainment) and alerts them when they are close to overspending.
- **Goal Setting:** Allows users to set financial goals (e.g., saving for a car or vacation) and track progress over time.
- **Analytics and Reports:** Provides graphs, charts, and reports to visualize spending habits, savings, and financial health trends.
- **Currency Support:** Enables transactions in multiple currencies with live exchange rate updates for international users.
- **Bank Integration:** (Advanced Feature) Option to link users’ bank accounts to pull in real-time transaction data and update their budgets automatically.
	

This proposal focuses on solving the problem of financial disorganization by offering a simple, accessible tool for individuals to better manage their money and improve financial literacy. You can further develop this proposal based on your specific focus areas within banking or financial institutions.
